    <h2>Welcome to the Random Charizard info page!</h2>
    <p> Charmander(Charizard pre-evo) is now shiny-huntable in the Pkmn S/V Indigo Disc DLC. Also people love to hate on it for being spoiled by Pokemon but gardevoir, gengar and PIKACHU, the mascot of Pokemon are RIGHT THERE!</p>

    <p>This is shiny Charizard. Pretty cool,eh? The models in this game have also been revamped, and charizard looks more fierce and is able to stand on the floor in battle as opposed to just floating in the air(This is a 3D model from Pokemon Scarlet/Violet.)</p>
